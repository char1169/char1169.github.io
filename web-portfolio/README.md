Welcome To My IMD Portfolio!

My name is Melodie Chartrand and today I will be walking you through how I created my portfolio as well as the challenges I have faced throught his project and how I overcame them! 

1. I started with creating the index.html file. I coded most of the HTML before css, which is to me, the easiest way to do it! 

2. I then coded the about.html and contact.html. Since this is a Portfolio, making 3-4 pages is the ideal since keeping it very basic and simple give the opportunity to focus on the work YOU have created, which is the main piece. 

3. I then started to code the CSS. I started with the mobile styles and moves on to tablet then desktop. This order is the most efficient way to do it.

4. I added an active state to my navigation which gives it a fun feature. I also created a fun contact page.

5. This portfolio was based off of a mockup I made in my UX class and I tried my best to re-create it!




CHALLENGES

I had a bit of complication with the active state underline in my navigation but I resolved it by fixing my html.




WHAT I LEARNED

Making this portfolio taught me that LESS IS MORE!!! Simple portfolios are the way to go as you are not showcasing a brand you are showcasing YOU.
